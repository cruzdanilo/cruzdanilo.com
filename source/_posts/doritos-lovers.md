doritos lovers are 3d avatars generated randomly and released when you point the augmented reality marker on the back of a doritos sweet chili pack to your webcam. once released, they interact with the lovers of other users. there was also a social network application for orkut, where the lovers could interact. on the website you could use the augmented reality marker on the pack again to take a picture with you doritos lover. the avatar system that was created for this project is very complex if compared to what was used for 3d on web at the time. the lovers are made of several parts (legs, body, arms, face, textures, a lot of accessories) that are rigged, skinned and animated separately. using reference helpers, those parts are connected creating trillions (yes, trillions!) of character possibilities.
